React applications are isomorphic, providing universal rendering (even on the server side for SPA’s, single page applications) 
and they implement Virtual DOM’s. These features make user actions interactive. Also, re-rendering will be done at vast speed. 
React reinforces SEO with the help of its routers. Besides, react has built-in features for implementing routers for 
single-page applications. On a whole, react has a clear upper hand in this line.
